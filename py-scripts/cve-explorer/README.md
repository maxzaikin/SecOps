# 🛡️ CVE Explorer

**CVE Explorer** is a CLI tool for quickly identifying and logging known vulnerabilities (CVEs) for specific software versions. It automates the process of checking software against trusted vulnerability databases such as **NVD** (National Vulnerability Database) and optionally **MITRE CVE**.

> 📦 Part of the [Security Operations Toolkit](../README.md)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

In security operations, keeping track of known vulnerabilities in third-party components and dependencies is a critical step in risk assessment and patch management.  
**CVE Explorer** streamlines this process by:

- 🔍 Automatically resolving CPE names from software name and version
- 📬 Fetching CVE details from trusted vulnerability databases
- 🧾 Appending findings to a versioned, deduplicated CSV log
- 🧪 Supporting proxy configs and CLI-based usage (ideal for CI/CD or internal scanning)

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Fetch CVEs from **NVD**, optionally from **MITRE**
- ✅ Extract key risk indicators: severity, CVSS score, attack vector, published date
- ✅ Log results in an append-only CSV file: `vulnerabilities_log_v3.csv`
- ✅ Avoid duplicates and track timestamp of detection
- ✅ Can be easily embedded in pipelines or audit scripts

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Prepare a .env file

Create .env in the same folder as the script:

```bash
NVD_API_KEY=your-nvd-key-here
MITRE_API_KEY=your-mitre-key-here
```

🔐 You can get your NVD key from: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
MITRE key is optional and only needed if using --source mitre.

3. Run the script

```bash
python cve-explorer.py --app apache --ver 2.4.54
```

```text
    Optional arguments:
    Argument	Description
    --app	Software name (e.g. log4j)
    --ver	Software version (e.g. 2.17.0)
    --source
```

📄 Output Example

CSV log is stored as vulnerabilities_log_v3.csv, e.g.:
recorded_at	software	version	cve_id	severity	cvss_score	source
2025-07-06T13:00:05	apache	2.4.54	CVE-2022-12345	HIGH	7.5	NVD
